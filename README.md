# Credit-Card-Defaulters-Prediction  
Evaluating performance of different Supervised ML algorithms and compared their performance  
  
### Purpose:
The goal of this project is to compare several machine learning models to predict whether the customers are going to default their credit card payment or not for the next month.     
  
### Dataset:   
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients  
Includes 30,000 observations and 24 features.  
  
### Technical Requirements:  
•	Python 3.7.6  
•	Sklearn 0.23.2  
•	Pandas 1.0.1  
•	Matplotlib 3.1.3  
  
### Project Deliverables:  
•	Data pre-processing  
•	Data Exploration  
•	Feature selection  
•	Hyper Parameter Tuning using GridSearchCV  
•	Evaluating different ML models (Logistic Regression, kNN, Random Forest, SVC, Naïve Bayesian)
